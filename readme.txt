Please extract all the contents to a single folder. To reproduce the results of the 'Reduced Look Ahead Orthogonal Matching Pursuit' paper at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=6811329&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6811329, please run the following files
1) Gaussian_Clean.m 2) Rademacher_Clean.m 3) Gaussian_Noisy.m 4) Rademacher_Noisy.m. These generate the 8 plots required over an extended range of fraction of measurement. For the exact same plots, please adjust the values of M (no. of measurements). This is documented in the simulation_setup.m file.
